# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Pull-Up Training Tracker

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Name

Pull-Up Training Tracker MVP

### 1.2 Product Description

The Pull-Up Training Tracker is a mobile-responsive web application designed to help advanced users (capable of 15-20 pull-ups) systematically track their pull-up training progress and receive AI-powered training session recommendations. The application provides structure, accountability, and intelligent progression planning for consistent pull-up training improvement.

**IMPORTANT: This is an authenticated-only application. All users must register and log in to access any functionality. There is no guest or unauthenticated access to the application features.**

### 1.3 Target Audience

Advanced fitness enthusiasts and athletes who:

- Can perform 15-20 or more pull-ups
- Want to systematically improve their pull-up performance
- Value data-driven training progression
- Need accountability and structured planning
- Train in gym environments where they use mobile devices

### 1.4 Platform

Web application with mobile-first responsive design, optimized for mobile browsers as users will primarily record workouts immediately after training in gym environments.

### 1.5 Core Value Proposition

Users can record their training history, track progress over time, and leverage AI (OpenAI GPT-4) to generate optimal training sessions based on their performance data, without requiring extensive knowledge of training periodization.

## 2. User Problem

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Pull-up training requires significant consistency and structured progression, which many users struggle to maintain independently. Without proper planning and progression strategies, users often:

- Plateau in their performance
- Over-train or under-train
- Lose motivation due to lack of visible progress
- Struggle to determine appropriate volume and intensity
- Lack accountability and structure in their training

### 2.2 Current Alternatives

- Generic fitness tracking apps (not specialized for pull-up progression)
- Manual spreadsheet tracking (time-consuming, no AI recommendations)
- Personal trainers (expensive, not always accessible)
- Ad-hoc training without structured progression

### 2.3 Solution Approach

A specialized web application that combines simple training logging with AI-powered progression planning, specifically designed for pull-up training with automatic analysis of performance data to suggest optimal next sessions.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Authentication and User Management

**AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENT**: All application features require user authentication. Users must register and log in before accessing any functionality. The following routes are public: `/` (landing page with login/register CTAs), `/login`, and `/register`. All other routes require authentication and will redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`.
